## Bbbase

A web style guide generator heavily influenced by Jeremy Keith's [Pattern Primer](https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer) and Anna Debenham's [Font-end style guide](https://github.com/maban/styleguide). Bbbase is a good place to start a design project and document front-end design patterns.
